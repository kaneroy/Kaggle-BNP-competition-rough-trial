As this is an excercise, I do not clean my code because someone can read what I am thinking and trying during the first part of the code. 
From "re-cleaning data" part, the real work starts. 

This competition does not show any meaning of features except listing the number of features. Thus, I cannot do many feature engineering jobs
except filling in the missing values, transfer obj variable to int and ect. 

My laptop cannot run gridsearch cross validation for random forest due to limited computing resources so I tried a decision tree too which 
is the base for building random forest. The purpose of this trial is for an interview to show some data analytics skills so maybe the result
is not so important as long as I show the procedure to do it.

Although results may be not good, this code shows my understanding of how to deal with such problems and it is done from the beginning to the 
end within one day. There are many more techniques to improve results such as blending more models, doing some feature engineering to create
more features or using PCA to clean and preclude some features in the beginning. I believe a good model is done by trying lots of methods to 
fit the data and it is just time-consuming to reach the best. For the purpose of this trial, this code will not be used for kaggle competition.
